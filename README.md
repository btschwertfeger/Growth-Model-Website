## üìç About the Project

Growth, development and progress are the fundamental processes of life.

This website was developed to support the [project](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/awi_paleodyn/growth-model-atlantic-cod) of Nadezhda Sokolova, which thematizes a growth model for the altantic cod. It provides general information about the model as well as dynamic and customizable diagrams to experiment with the input parameters of a simplified growth model and serves as supporting material for knowledge transfer and research.

### Content

In the first section, a "real world" experiment is in the foreground, in which the working method of this growth model is shown. Here, the data were calculated in advance within the framework of the work, since this would go beyond the scope of a static website.

Nevertheless, different climate scenarios have been chosen for the celtic sea and barents sea.
which can be used to read off the growth rates of the altantic code.

The last section offers the possibility to run the growth model with different parameters. The results of the parameter changes can be followed live and offer interested parties the possibility to investigate the effects of different conditions.

![ Website Plot 3](images/page-view-3.png)

This website was developed as part of [Benjamin T. Schwertfeger](https://b-schwertfeger.de)'s work at the [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de) and serves as supporting material for knowledge transfer and research.
